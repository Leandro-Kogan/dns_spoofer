DNS_SPOOFER:
For this script to work properly you need to be the man in the middle, this means between the victims machine and the access point. You do that by spoofing the arp protocol 
that says to the victim machine that you are the access point and says to the access point that you are the victim machine.
This script does not work with HTTPS that uses SSL or HSTS, but for SSL there are tools that can help you by-pass it...
